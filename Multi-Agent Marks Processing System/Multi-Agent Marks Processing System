Multi-Agent Marks Processing System
Agents to Implement
InterfaceAgent

Reads marks from the user via console input.

Sends marks to TotalAgent and AverageAgent.

Displays results received.

Sends average to GradeAgent and displays final grade.

TotalAgent

Computes the total of all marks.

AverageAgent

Computes the average of all marks.

GradeAgent

Determines grade based on average.

Suggested Grade Rules
A → average ≥ 75

B → 60 ≤ average < 75

C → 50 ≤ average < 60

F → average < 50

Move Forward:

Choose at least two to implement:

Enhanced Grading System

Add a Grade D for averages between 40–49.

Add "Pass/Fail" remark along with grade.

Highest and Lowest Marks

Create a new agent StatsAgent that calculates:

Highest mark

Lowest mark

Send results back to InterfaceAgent.

Multiple Students Support

Modify InterfaceAgent to accept marks for 2 students (e.g., two lines of input).

Send each line separately to the agents and display results.

Weighted Average

Assume subjects have different weights (e.g., Math = 3, English = 2, Science = 1).

Modify AverageAgent to compute weighted average.

Grade Justification

Extend GradeAgent to explain why a grade was given (e.g., “Average 71.6 falls into B range”).
